##  Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end intelligent system that aids **law enforcement agencies** by converting **voice descriptions of suspects** into **visual mugshots**.

It leverages:
-  **OpenAI Whisper** for automatic speech transcription
-  **LLaMA 3.2B Instruct** (via HuggingFace) for trait extraction
-  **Stable Diffusion XL (Base + Refiner)** for high-fidelity image generation

##  How It Works

1. ** Audio Input:**  
   The system accepts an `.mp3` or `.wav` file containing a verbal description of a suspect.

2. **‚úç Speech-to-Text:**  
   The audio is transcribed using **Whisper** with medium accuracy model.

3. ** Attribute Extraction:**  
   The transcribed description is passed to **LLaMA 3.2B** to extract structured features such as:
   - Gender, Age, Build, Race
   - Facial Features, Hair, Eyes, Skin Tone
   - Distinctive Traits, Clothing, etc.

4. ** Image Prompt Generation:**  
   These features are formatted into a natural language prompt for visual synthesis.

5. ** Image Generation:**  
   The prompt is processed using **Stable Diffusion XL**, first via the base model, then refined for higher quality output.

6. ** Output:**  
   The resulting mugshot is saved and displayed automatically.

## üìÇ Example Usage

```bash
# Ensure your environment includes:
# whisper, torch, transformers, diffusers, accelerate, PIL

# Step 1: Transcribe audio
python transcribe.py --file path/to/audio.mp3

# Step 2: Extract features
python extract_traits.py --text "transcribed text from step 1"

# Step 3: Generate image
python generate_image.py --prompt "auto-generated prompt from step 2"
